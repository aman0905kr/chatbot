My Chatbot Project represents my journey into the realm of artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Through this endeavor, I aim to showcase the incredible potential of language models in diverse applications.

With advanced technologies at my disposal, I've created a collection of chatbots tailored to different contexts and purposes. Here's an overview of what my chatbots offer:

- **Friendly Chatbot**: Engage in delightful conversations and explore the capabilities of AI.
- **Memory-Enhanced Chatbot**: Experience the power of machine learning as the chatbot learns and adapts to user interactions over time.
- **News Chatbot**: Stay informed and up-to-date with current events by interacting with this internet-connected chatbot.
- **Document Assistant**: Access valuable information from custom documents through intuitive conversations with the chatbot.

Each chatbot is a testament to the versatility and ingenuity of artificial intelligence. Feel free to dive in and interact with them to witness firsthand the magic of human-machine interaction!
